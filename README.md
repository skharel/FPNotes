## Mathematical properties

1. Associative
  
    simply put its about grouping things in different order and still getting same result 
    
    * (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) [Addition]
    * (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) [Multiplication]
    * division are not commutative. eg (10 / 4 ) / 2 != 10 / (4 / 2)
    
2. Commutative
   
   variables are commuting from their location
  
    * x * y = y * x
    * x + y = Y + x
    
    - division are not commutative
    
3. Distributive
  
    * x * (y + z) = x * y + x * z
    
4. Identity

    * x + 0 = x
    * x * 1 = x
    
    
## Semigroup
    - associative and closed
    
    * associative => can be grouped in any way
    * closed => takes in datatype and returns same type
        eg: takes in integer and returns integer
     
    > Because you can associate in different way, you can run multiple groups in parallel and finally gather the result from the multiple groups. eg: 2 + 3 + 4 + 5. You can run 2 + 3 & 4 +5 in parallel. Finally operate on the result of these groups and return one final result
