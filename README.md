## Mathematical properties

1. Associative
  
    simply put its about grouping things in different order and still getting same result 
    
    * (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) [Addition]
    * (x * y) * z = x * (y * z) [Multiplication]
    * division are not commutative. eg (10 / 4 ) / 2 != 10 / (4 / 2)
    
2. Commutative
   
   variables are commuting from their location
  
    * x * y = y * x
    * x + y = Y + x
    
    - division are not commutative
    
3. Distributive
  
    * x(y + z) = x * y + x * z
    
4. Identity

    * x + 0 = x
    * x * 1 = x
